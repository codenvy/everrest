 * Abstraction which "encapsulates the activities of accessing resources and
 * transferring resource representations. The connectors present an abstract
 * interface for component communication, enhancing simplicity by providing a
 * clean separation of concerns and hiding the underlying implementation of
 * resources and communication mechanisms".<br/>
 * "REST connectors provide a generic interface for accessing and manipulating
 * the value set of a resource, regardless of how the membership function is
 * defined or the type of software that is handling the request."
